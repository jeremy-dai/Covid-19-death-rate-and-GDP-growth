# Covid-19-death-rate-and-GDP-growth

## Project Motivation
On the threshold of the pandemic, some politicians insisted "the solution cannot be worse than the problem" and refused to introduce lockdown to save people's lives. Now that 2020 has passed, we can compare the GDP growth rate and excess death of 2020 between different countries.

This projects looks into the data of Excess Death and GDP growth rate during the pandemic year 2020.


## Data Sources
- Excess Death: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/excess-deaths/
- Economic Growth: https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDP_RPCH@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD/

## Data Descriptions
The excess death data is compiled by the New York Times, which is the number of actual deaths minus the expected deaths (the expected death is estimated based on historical averages). The number of excess deaths is often used to measure the severity of a large-scale issue such as the pandemic.
